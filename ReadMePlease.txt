Change Log:
-A Constants was added to make handling the variables much easier.
-Ids were added for art loading and for level mappings etc.
-SonLvL compatibility was added (Green Hill is impossible to edit due to how the game is mounted and its data reading).
-Everything possible of the code was commented as well as data was reorganized and the art was compiled so that it was possible to edit it with SonMapEd or Flex2 (Some art data could not be compiled since they produced errors)
